gcs-helper
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NYTimes/gcs-helper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NYTimes/gcs-helper)

gcs-helper is inspired by
[s3-helper](https://github.com/crunchyroll/evs-s3helper) and is used to provide
access to private GCS buckets. It's intended to be used in private networks.

One example use case is the usage along with [Kaltura's
nginx-vod-module](https://github.com/kaltura/nginx-vod-module).
